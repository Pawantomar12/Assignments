    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows us to hide the implementation detail from the user and shows only the functionality of the programming to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, abstraction in OOP enables the hiding of the internal details of an object from the outside world, so that the focus is on what the object does, rather than how it does it\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a car. A driver only needs to know how to drive a car and not how it works internally. The driver doesnâ€™t need to know how fuel is burned or how power is generated; they only need to know how to operate it1. This is an example of abstraction."

    "\n",
    "Ans: The abc module in Python provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract base classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are designed to be subclassed by other classes. The abc module works by marking methods of the base class as abstract using the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concrete class which is a subclass of such abstract base class then implements the abstract base by overriding its abstract methods2. This allows for a consistent interface across multiple classes.\n"
